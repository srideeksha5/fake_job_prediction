# Fake Job Post Detection

This project is focused on detecting fraudulent job postings using machine learning. The notebook contains the full pipeline from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, to training and evaluating a classification model.

##  Project Overview

Job scams are becoming increasingly common, and detecting fake job postings can help protect users from fraud and identity theft. This project leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify job postings as either real or fake.

##  Features

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text preprocessing (e.g., removing stopwords, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix visualization

##  Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle - Fake Job Postings](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction), which contains information about job postings including title, description, requirements, and a target label indicating whether the post is fraudulent.
